Human who suffering from the image that he is controlling his body or his spirit through his "self" should forget that nonsense. Just try to live like a robot as a metaphor toward suicide, an un-fatal way to kill his tumult from his fake heart and keep persueing his really and fundamentally desired "things", like a machine chasing for its maximality of effect function.

When you cannot decide which seat should you seat in the library: throw a dart or chair cushion and sit on the chair it finally hit. 

I LOVE cats, if I could ignore that they usually bring their excrements to bed... or hide it until the excrements have been dried before I find out where they hide their "surplus excrements". Castration is really needed for cats in oestrus.
