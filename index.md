Human who suffering from the image that he is controlling his body or his spirit through his "self" should forget that nonsense. Just try to live like a robot as a metaphor toward suicide, an un-fatal way to kill his tumult from his fake heart and keep persueing his really and fundamentally desired "things", like a machine chasing for its maximality of effect function.
