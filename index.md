I can't say why I usually like to go to library, the crowded, sweaty library, in which the stochastic viberation of human behaviors lead to the murmur of the physical world. Maybe that's the perverted eccentricity of being gazed by others or... so called L'Autre? I dont know... 

I hate homework, I hate bugs, and I love salmon. The essence of the whole world is my cat having a fresh, sweet, greasy piece of salmon. I can't imagine what a gorgeous picture that will be. 

" I choose to send my cat to the moon, I choose to send my cat to mars or further in this century and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of my energy and skills, because that challenge is one that I'm willing to accept, one I'm  unwilling to postpone, and one I intend to win, and the others, too. "

Human who suffering from the image that he is controlling his body or his spirit through his "self" should forget that nonsense. Just try to live like a robot as a metaphor toward suicide, an un-fatal way to kill his tumult from his fake heart and keep pursueing his really and fundamentally desired "things", like a machine chasing for its maximality of effect function.

When you cannot decide which seat should you sit in the library: throw a dart or chair cushion and sit on the chair it finally hit. 

I LOVE cats, if I could ignore that they usually bring their excrements to bed... or hide it until the excrements have been dried before I find out where they hide their "surplus excrements". Castration is really needed for cats in oestrus.
